# LiveTwitcher
A little software to use livestreamer. Watch your favorites Twitch streams with just a click.

If you have any ideas feel free to share/ask.

It's my first "public" app so be nice please :P

How it works:
- This application require livestreamer and VLC and start in the taskbar notify space
- Just start this app (1 click on the icon in the taskbar), it'll ask you for your Twitch username (no password required) and will automatically load your favorites streams !
- ???
- Enjoy

Here is a little list of available functionnalities:
- Look at any Twitch user favorites
- Select default quality
- Start a stream with a different quality (right click on button)
- Always show this window on top
- Show/Hide livestreamer window

There is actually no installer, just copy the program in a folder (with DLLs and resources) and start it. I personnally made a shortcut into the "Start" folder in the startmenu to automatically launch it at startup.

Thanks for your interest.

READY TO USE APP IS IN THE "LiveTwitcher" FOLDER AND "READY TO USE" FOLDER :)

PS: I know there is MANY improvments to do with this app but I try to update it as fast as I can :)
