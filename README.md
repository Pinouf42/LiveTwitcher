# LiveTwitcher
A little software to use livestreamer. Watch your favorites Twitch streams with just a click.

If you have any ideas feel free to share/ask.

It's my first "public" app so be nice please :P

How it works:
- This application require livestreamer and VLC and start in the taskbar notify space
- Just start this app (1 click on the icon in the taskbar), it'll ask you for your Twitch username (no password required) and will automatically load your favorites streams !
- ???
- Enjoy

Here is a little list of available functionnalities:
- Look at any Twitch user favorites
- Select default quality
- Start a stream with a different quality (right click on button)
- Always show this window on top
- Show/Hide livestreamer window

Thanks for your interest.
